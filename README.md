# CustomScrimbaPortfolio
Portfolio site made by following Scrimba 'Build and Deploy a Portfolio site' https://scrimba.com/g/gportfolio
Built to learn Flexbox, Grid, CSS Custom Properties.

# Introduction
  The purpose of this project was threefold. I wanted practice in building a portfolio website, have a template to showcase my projects, and learn more about responsive web design. I wanted to do all of this in a way to learn best practices.
  
# Why I chose Scrimba

   Most tutorials online assume the viewer comes from little to no coding expierence, and as a result explain things I already know or don't go into too much depth. This tutorial seemed to go right into the project and assumed the viewer knew of basics of html and css, so seemed to be a better jumping off point for me. However, looking back I believe I misjudged my own understanding and the knowledge required to fully understand the material. For instance, while the course does introduce one to flex and grid, it does not provide much introduction to them. The same is true for custom properties, though to a lesser extent. I may have done a little better looking at flex and grid first, then doing this course to get the most knowledge. 

# Things I Learned
  How to translate a template into workable code, starting with basic html structure then moving on to css styles.

  How to build a css style sheet, using custom properties for general styles, and things like var to avoid rewriting code. What rem and em are. Shadows and realism.
# Future Plans

-Continue to refine the site, making it my own.
-Add pages showing other projects I have done, with links to their own sites as needed.
